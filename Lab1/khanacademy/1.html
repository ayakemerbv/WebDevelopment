    <h1>Poem of my life</h1>
    <p>A love forbidden by faults of the past,<br>
a simple love that ended so fast.<br>
A love made quite impossible to bare,<br>
a love so fragile and unfair.<br>
A love we want yet never get,<br>
a love like that of Romeo and Juliet.<br>
Young yet sure of what we do feel,<br>
yet a love that doesn't always seem as real.</p>
